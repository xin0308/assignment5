    //Hint:
    //1. The bars are drawn as rectangles
    //2. Add a mouseover event to the bar
    //3. The mouseover event should also highlight the corresponding points in the scatter plot
    //4. The mouseout event should remove the highlight from the corresponding points in the scatter plot 
    //5. You can refer to the code in the drawScatterPlot function 

    //Task 8: Connect the bar chart with the scatter plot
    //Hint:
    //1. Add a mouseover event to the bar
    //2. The mouseover event should also highlight the corresponding points in the scatter plot
